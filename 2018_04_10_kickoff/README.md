This presentation was created by [R-Ladies Lausanne](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_lausanne/blob/master/20180201_kickoff/2018-02-01-kickoff-presentation.key); thank you! We have modified it for R-Ladies Santa Barbara.

Debrief after the kickoff event: 

- Attendance: we capped RSVPs at 60, 6 were on the waitlist. ~46 attended.
- Food/Drinks: we asked several attendees to donate a six-pack of beer, bottle of wine, sparkling water, or snacks. Estimated 2 drinks/person, and had ~20 beers and 6 bottles of wine left over. Sparkling water was very popular. 
- Schedule: before the presentation, Jamie introduced herself and NCEAS, then Allison and Julie introduced themselves. Julie walked through the first half of the presentation (RLadies Global), then Allison finished (RLadies SB). Then, we did a surprise ice breaker (not on the schedule):
- Ice breaker: we did the human barometer icebreaker like [Stefanie Butland did super successfully at rOpenSci's unconf17](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/11/17/unconf-sixtips/). Our 3 questions: 
    1. Cats or Dogs?
    1. How long have you lived in SB?
    1. What is your comfort in R?
- Ideas bowl: we had a bowl and post-it notes where attendees could write what they hoped for our RLadies Chapter. We got a lot of [great ideas](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HhvioiEY4vqJviBQuJMY3IKB1TxkTpfVEJrh-KFU7QU/edit?usp=sharing)!

We met a lot of great ladies and men, got great feedback, and are excited to continue building this community!
